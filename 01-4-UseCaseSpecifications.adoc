=== Use Case Specifications

A detailed use case specification describes a use case in greater detail.
It should have a main success scenario, as well as alternate scenarios in case something unusal happens.
Steps are numbered.
Alternatives to step 1 are labelled 1a, 1b, and so on.
Then the steps in the alternative scenario 1a are labelled 1a.1, 1a.2, and so on.
An alternative scenario may end in success, it may end in failure, or the use case may continue at another step.
