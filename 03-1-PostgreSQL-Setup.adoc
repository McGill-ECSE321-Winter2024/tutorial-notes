=== Setting Up a Local PostgreSQL Database
In this section, we will set up a local PostgreSQL database to store our application's data.

==== Installation
Download the latest version of PostgreSQL from https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads. Once the download is complete, run the installer. You can stick with the default values for most screens.

The default installation directory should be fine.

Leave every component checked.

The default data directory should be fine.

Choose a password. _IMPORTANT: do not forget this password. You will need it later._

The default port number should be fine. However, there's no problem using a different port number in case a different app is using 5432 for some reason. Just remember your choice so that you know which port your app should connect to. Here is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers[list of typical TCP/UDP ports] and their reservation status. *Do not use a port that is reserved.*

The default locale should be fine.

The summary might look something like this:

There's no need for other tools, so you can skip the Stack Builder after the installation by unchecking the checkbox.

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you should be able to connect to your local instance by running the command `psql --username postgres` and entering your password (I hope you haven't forgotten it already).
If you didn't use the default port number, you can pass the additional command-line argument `--port` (e.g., `psql --username postgres --port 5433`).

NOTE: If you get an error with some variation of the message "command 'psql' not found," then you likely need to add `psql` to your PATH environment variable.
It should be straightforward to find online instructions to do so on your operating system.

For the course project, each team member will need to set up a separate database instance on their own computer.
To simplify configuring your app to connect to the database, each team member should use the same password and port number.
If you initially chose different passwords, you can change your password by running `psql`, running the command `\password postgres`, and then entering the new password when prompted.
You can similarly change the port number (e.g., by following https://www.commandprompt.com/education/how-to-change-default-port-in-postgresql/[these instructions]).
In short:

. In `psql`, run the command `show config_file;` (note the trailing semicolon) to locate the configuration file which stores the port number.
. Exit `psql`.
. Open the configuration file, locate the line `port = 5432` (where 5432 is replaced by your old port number), change the port number, and save the file.
. Restart the PostgreSQL service (or just restart your computer).

==== Creating a Database

One database management system (in this case, PostgreSQL) can host multiple databases.
In `psql`, create a new database for the event registration app using the command
```
CREATE DATABASE event_registration;
```

Check that the database exists by running the command `\l`:
