=== Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe characteristics that we expect the application to have.
For example, we might have expectations about the system's speed, the amount of memory or storage it uses, how user-friendly it is, etc.
Here are some examples of non-functional requirements for the event registration app.

.Speed
====
. When a user creates a valid event, the event registration application shall save the event and provide confirmation in more more than 2 seconds, 95% of the time.
====

.Memory consumption
====
. The event registration application shall not use more than 250 MB of memory on an end user's computer at any time.
====

.Usability
====
. The event registation application shall be sufficiently user-friendly that a new user with basic computer literacy shall be able to create their account in no more than 15 minutes.
